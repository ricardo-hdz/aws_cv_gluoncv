        "3. Getting Started with Pre-trained Models on ImageNet\n===========================================================\n\n`ImageNet <http://www.image-net.org/>`__ is a\nlarge labeled dataset of real-world images. It is one of the most\nwidely used dataset in latest computer vision research.\n\n|imagenet|\n\nIn this tutorial, we will show how a pre-trained neural network\nclassifies real world images.\n\nFor your convenience, we provide a script that loads a pre-trained ``ResNet50_v2`` model,\nand classifies an input image.\nFor a list of all models we have, please visit `Gluon Model Zoo <../../model_zoo/index.html>`__.\n\nDemo\n------------------\n\nA model trained on ImageNet can classify images into 1000 classes, this makes it\nmuch more powerful than the one we showed in the `CIFAR10 demo <demo_cifar10.html>`__.\n\n:download:`Download demo_imagenet.py<../../../scripts/classification/imagenet/demo_imagenet.py>`\n\nWith this script, you can load a pre-trained model and classify any image you have.\n\nLet's test with the photo of Mt. Baker again.\n\n|image0|\n\n::\n\n    python demo_imagenet.py --model ResNet50_v2 --input-pic mt_baker.jpg\n\nAnd the model predicts that\n\n::\n\n    The input picture is classified to be\n        [volcano], with probability 0.558.\n        [alp], with probability 0.398.\n        [valley], with probability 0.018.\n        [lakeside], with probability 0.006.\n        [mountain_tent], with probability 0.006.\n\nThis time it does a good job. Note that we have listed the top five\nmost probable classes, because with 1000 classes the model may not always rank the\ncorrect answer highest. Besides top-1 accuracy, we often also\nconsider top-5 accuracy as a measurement of how well a model can predict.\n\nNext Step\n---------\n\nIf you would like to dive deeper into ``ImageNet`` training,\nfeel free to read the next tutorial on `ImageNet Training <dive_deep_imagenet.html>`__.\n\nOr, if you would like to know how to train a powerful model tailored to your own data,\nplease go ahead and read the tutorial on `Transfer learning <transfer_learning_minc.html>`__.\n\n.. |imagenet| image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/web-data/master/gluoncv/datasets/imagenet_mosaic.jpg\n.. |image0| image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmlc/web-data/master/gluoncv/classification/mt_baker.jpg\n"
